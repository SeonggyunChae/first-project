                        Artificial intelligence is a type of computer technology which is concerned with making machines work in an intelligent way, similar to the way that the human mind works. The abbreviation AI is also used. This course introduces the fundamental theories and technologies of artificial intelligence, the algorithms, theoretical mechanism necessary for then analysis of an AI system. In this course, students learn not only symbolic AI techniques but also comprehensive methodology used in the neural network and fuzzy logic area.
